Altitude of drone at starting point is 1000m and your height is 1.5m. This drone has to be detected and tracked in real-time. The distance of drone from you to be calculated along with the speed of the drone. Please share a solution for the above problem statement.

    "Hardware Requirements:\n",
    "   * requirements include a modern CPU with at least 4 cores and a reasonable amount of RAM (8GB or more).\n",
    "   * Having a GPU can significantly accelerate the inference speed.\n",
    "   * External camera or webcam connected to the computer for real-time object detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Software Requirements:\n",
    "   * Windows or Linux distributions are supported by OpenCV and YOLO.\n",
    "   * Python programming language (3.6 or higher).Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "   * OpenCV (cv2): For image and video processing, and deep neural networks integration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Approach:\n",
    "   * Camera at a height of 1.5m (at the person's height) to capture the drone's movement(speed and distance) and detect its presence.\n",
    "   * Install Python and necessary packages (opencv-python, numpy).\n",
    "   * Download yolov3.weights and yolov3.cfg and place them in the working directory (https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).\n",
    "   * Use OpenCV's cv2.dnn.readNet function to load the YOLOv3 model with yolov3.weights and yolov3.cfg.\n",
    "                                \n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "   * Without GPU acceleration, real-time performance may be limited, especially for high-resolution video streams.\n",
    "   * Object detection accuracy depends on the quality of pre-trained weights (yolov3.weights) and configuration (yolov3.cfg)\n",
